# Javascript-and-NodeJS-Projects
This repository consists of NodeJS projects built using great tools like Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.
1. A note-taking app

2. A weather application that interacts with the MapBox and Dark Sky APIs

3. A task manager REST API complete with user accounts and authentication

4. A real-time chat app with a client-side companion built using sockets

Please Note : The task-manager file is very huge and hence I have deleted the node modules folder. So, please install node modules to run the application. Run the command : $ npm init -y
